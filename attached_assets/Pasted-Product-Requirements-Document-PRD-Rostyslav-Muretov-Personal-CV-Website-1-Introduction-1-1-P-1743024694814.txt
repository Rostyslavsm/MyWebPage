Cons: Less customization, potential recurring costs, may not showcase technical skills directly.

Option 2: Custom Development (Showcases Skills, More Control):

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript. Could use a framework/library like React, Vue, or Angular if desired to showcase those skills.

Styling: CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS) or custom CSS.

Hosting: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages (excellent for static sites), AWS S3/CloudFront.

Pros: Full control over design and functionality, opportunity to demonstrate web development skills.

Cons: More time-consuming to build and maintain, requires coding knowledge.

7. Success Metrics

Positive feedback from recruiters/contacts who view the site.

Increase in profile views on LinkedIn (potentially tracked via UTM parameters).

Website analytics (if implemented): Number of visits, time on page, bounce rate, clicks on contact links/CV download.

Ultimately: Number of interview requests citing the website.

8. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

Adding a blog section to write about technical topics or projects.

Creating more detailed individual pages for each major project.

Implementing more advanced animations or interactive elements.

Integrating basic analytics tracking (e.g., Google Analytics).
